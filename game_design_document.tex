\section{Game Overview}
\label{sec:org701ab9f}
\subsection{Game Concept}
\label{sec:orgfa6df08}
Robotic Rebellion is a 3D bullet hell action roguelike set in a post robot uprising world where the few remaining humans are hidden in isolated comunities around the world.

A playable demo is available on github: \href{https://github.com/KeithButler-WIT/final\_year\_project}{GitHub - KeithButler-WIT/final\textsubscript{year}\textsubscript{project}}
\subsection{Feature Set}
\label{sec:org8a17784}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fast pace combat
\item Procedural level generation
\item Dynamic difficulty
\item Multiple upgrade paths
\item Boids based ai
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Genres}
\label{sec:org1199312}
3D, Bullet hell, Roguelike, Action, Auto-shooter, Top-down.
\subsection{Target Audience}
\label{sec:org4020dab}

This game is targeted towards people aged 12+ who are looking for a roguelike game that recreates the experience of playing characters such as Engineer in Team Fortress 2(Valve, 2007) and Engineer in Deep Rock Galactic(Ghost Ship Games, 2020).
\subsection{Game Flow Summary}
\label{sec:org9f57405}
Each level will be a fast paced action filled twenty plus minute mission.
\subsection{Look and Feel}
\label{sec:orgf8aa0c5}
The game world is set in a expansive factory compound where almost every surface of the ground is dotted with various forms of machinery.
The game will feature the aesthetic of playstation 1 era retro graphics
\subsection{Project Scope}
\label{sec:orgdd8983e}
\subsubsection{Number of locations}
\label{sec:orgd889448}

6 locations
\subsubsection{Number of levels}
\label{sec:orgd158bf6}

5 levels
\subsubsection{Number of weapons}
\label{sec:orgfd3ca31}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Player Weapons
\label{sec:org3ea8ae1}

Fists \\[0pt]
Crowbar \\[0pt]
Shield
\item Turret Weapons
\label{sec:orgd42d2d5}

4 elemental variations \\[0pt]
2 movement variations \\[0pt]

One elemental variation can be used in tandom with a movement variation to give the player a unique combat experience.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Gameplay and Mechanics}
\label{sec:org60de33d}
\subsection{Gameplay}
\label{sec:org101b3ce}
\subsubsection{Game Progression}
\label{sec:orgedc1568}

As the player progresses through the levels they will unlock points towards the upgrade system that can be used to customise their gameplay style.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Dynamic Difficulty
\label{sec:orgccc6bbc}

Similarly to Risk of Rain 2 (Hopoo Games, 2020).
The difficulty of the game depends on time spent in the level.
The difficulty starts at a low level at the begining of each level, every 3 minutes 0.25 more enemies spawn, each new enemy will also have 0.10\% more health and attack damage. \\[0pt]

This would encourage the player to move quickly and to complete the level before enemies get to difficult for them.
\item Upgrade system
\label{sec:orgd2a7426}
\begin{itemize}
\item 2 Skill trees
\begin{itemize}
\item Turret
\begin{itemize}
\item Increase number of turrets
\item Add mobility
\begin{itemize}
\item Increase move speed
\end{itemize}
\item Hunter mark (ability to make enemies to focus fire on)
\item Bullet pierce
\end{itemize}
\item Player
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of dashes
\item Distance of dashes
\item Delay between dashes
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Objectives}
\label{sec:orgb13ab08}
Player will have the choice of four objectives prior to selecting a mission.
The choices will be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Retrieve - The player find an item and brings it back to the spawn point.
\item Defend - The player is tasked with protecting a point on the map for a specific amount of time.
\item Destroy - The player is tasked to attack a specific point on the map.
\item Purge - The player is tasked to kill a specific number of enemies.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Mechanics}
\label{sec:orgfa20dbf}
\subsubsection{Physics}
\label{sec:org05b86f5}
Unitys built-in physics engine will be used for the games physics.
The engine ``is an integration of the PhysX engine in close partnership with NVIDIA'' (Unity, n.d.).
\subsubsection{Movement}
\label{sec:org381f800}
\begin{enumerate}
\item General Movement
\label{sec:orgebaa256}

The players movement will be controlled by the WASD keys when using a keyboard or by the left joystick when using a controller. \\[0pt]

For the first 0.5 seconds of movement the player will accelerate up to the max speed.

The max speed of the player is detemined by the weapon that's equipped.
\item Other Movement
\label{sec:orgcb6797b}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Dashing
\label{sec:org1e4cf56}

By pressing the \textbf{Space} button the player enters a 'dash' phase in which the player character is launched in the direction of travel.
This would allow the player to move past enemies or hazards with out being affected by them.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Objects}
\label{sec:org32fb163}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Picking Up Objects
\label{sec:org6cd2db5}

Pickup items will be picked up when the player collised with the objects
\item Moving Objects
\label{sec:orgab28fff}

Crate and box objects that are marked with yellow paint can be pushed by the player.
As the player is colliding with the moveable objects and is trying to move the boxes into an empt space the players base speed is halved
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Actions}
\label{sec:orgd638caa}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Picking Up, Carrying and Dropping
\label{sec:org8702f79}

Certain items can be picked up by the player.

For the player to pickup items all the player has to do is walk on top of the item and it is automatically picked up.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Combat}
\label{sec:orgf6b9bca}
The focus of the combat will be placed on the placeable turrents that the player has.
The turrets will target the closest enemy to them distance wise.

The player will be able to use weak attack that's not ideal for dealing with groups of enemies.
The will also have access to a shield that while it cannot directly do damage itself it can knock back groups of enemies allowing the player it to be strategicly used in tandom with the turrets or just as a safely net for the player.

\section{Artificial Intelligence}
\label{sec:org230e117}
\subsection{Enemy AI}
\label{sec:org7d056b4}
Opponent AI will use a modified boids algorithm to simulate a swarm like movement.
The boid model 'is able to simulate complex flocking behavior as a result of coordinated motion by implementing three simple rules that define the steering behavior of each boid' (Mavhemwa and Nyangani, n.d.).

Such an algorithm will allow the enemies to gather in numbers before attacking the player.
This will appear to give the enemies a semblance of strategic thinking from the players point of view.

\section{Project Management}
\label{sec:orga4dab4b}
\subsection{Project Methodology}
\label{sec:org271936c}
The scrum methodology will be used.
Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.
\subsection{Detailed Schedule}
\label{sec:org2953800}
The project will consist of a total of six sprints, each sprint being twelve day long.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rllll}
Sprint & Start Date & End Date & Deliverables & Prototype Link\\[0pt]
\hline
1 & 01/01/2024 & 14/01/2024 & Prototype 1 & \\[0pt]
2 & 15/01/2024 & 28/01/2024 & Prototype 2 & \\[0pt]
3 & 29/01/2024 & 11/02/2024 & Prototype 3 & \\[0pt]
4 & 12/02/2024 & 25/02/2024 & Prototype 4 & \\[0pt]
5 & 26/02/2024 & 10/03/2024 &  & \\[0pt]
6 & 11/03/2024 & 25/03/2024 & Final Game & \\[0pt]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\subsection{Schedule management}
\label{sec:org2ccab92}
\href{https://trello.com/}{Trello} will be used for schedule management and as a scrum/kanban board.

Trello’s look and feel are based on the principles of a Kanban board. (Solomon, n.d.)

Trello has a free tier that makes it an ideal choice for a small team of developers.
\subsection{Version control}
\label{sec:org61d5fd6}
Git/Github will be the version control method used when building this project.
Git has been chosen over Unity Collaborate.
\subsection{Risk Analysis}
\label{sec:org0f0f54d}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Risk & Mitigation\\[0pt]
\hline
Project scope too big to be completed in the time frame & Know when and what to scale back if required.\\[0pt]
 & \\[0pt]
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\subsection{Test Plan}
\label{sec:org3d214dc}
The last 2 days of each sprint will be dedicated to playtests.
